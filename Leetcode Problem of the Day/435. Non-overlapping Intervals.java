/*
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to 
make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

Constraints:
    1 <= intervals.length <= 105
    intervals[i].length == 2
    -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
