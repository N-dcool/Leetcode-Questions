/*
Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

 

Example 1:
    Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
    Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
    Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
    "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
    "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

Example 2:
    Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
    Output: ["catdog"]

Constraints:
    1 <= words.length <= 104
    1 <= words[i].length <= 30
    words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
    All the strings of words are unique.
    1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105
